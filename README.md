# Calculator-
ðŸ§® Just built my very own calculator from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸŽ‰ It's been a fantastic learning experience, and I'm excited to share it with you all. ðŸ’»âœ¨

From simple arithmetic to handling complex expressions, this little project taught me so much about web development and problem-solving. ðŸš€ðŸ”¢

Swipe to see how it works and let me know what you think! ðŸ™Œ #CodeLife #WebDevelopment #JavaScript #HTML #CSS #CodingJourney #DeveloperLife #Techie #SelfTaught #Programming
